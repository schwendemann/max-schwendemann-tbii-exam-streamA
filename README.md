# max-schwendemann-tbii-exam-streamA

This repository contains my Tech Basics II Exam Project code. 


I have built a MVP for Wortschatzl - an app to learn, use and store beautiful German words:
When you run the `app.py` you are greeted with a homepage, which has three buttons that each lead to a subpage of the app. Depending on which button you choose you can either:
- Start you learning journey immediately by getting two nice German words you have to build a sentence with. Every time you get the spelling right you get a coin. The practice makes the words stick in your head.
- Have a look at the words that are already part of your word treasure chest "Wortschatzl".
- Add new words that inspire or amuse you to the "Wortschatzl" so you can learn and remember them later.
