This repository contains my Tech Basics II Exam Project code. 

I have built a MVP for Wortschatzl - an app to learn, use and store beautiful German words:
When you run the app.py you are greeted with a homepage, which has three buttons that each lead to a subpage of the app. Depending on which button you choose you can either:
- Start you learning journey immediately by getting two nice German words you have to build a sentence with. Everytime you get the spelling right you get a coin. The practice makes the words stick in you head.
- Have a look at the words that are already part of your word treasure chest "Wortschatzl"
- Add new words that inspire or amuse you and that you want to remember to the "Wortschatzl" word list
